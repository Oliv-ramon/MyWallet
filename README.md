### About this project

This is one of the projects of my personal portfolio, so, any feedback about the project, code or anything that you can report that could make me a better developer will be welcome!

In this app you can sign-up(just need a valid email, user,name and make the passwords match), login, with your email and password, and start to manage your money registering any transaction. you can also delect any transaction and make a logout (all this is demonstrated in the gif using the app).

This project was my first full-stack project(MyWallet - check the backend on the pinned projects), that is why the layout is so basic, by the way, i build this interface to test my knowlodge about react, react router, react hooks, styled componentes, context API and try to improve my architecture skills.

I'll add two more feature in the future: when you click in the name of some transaction, it turn into a input that allow you to update the name of the the transaction.
